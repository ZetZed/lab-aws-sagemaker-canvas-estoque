# ðŸ“Š Intelligent Stock Forecasting on AWS with [SageMaker Canvas](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/sagemaker/canvas/)

Welcome to the "Intelligent Stock Forecasting on AWS with SageMaker Canvas" project challenge. In this project, you will learn how to use SageMaker Canvas to create stock forecasts based on Machine Learning (ML). We will detail the entire process, from selecting the dataset to analyzing the prediction results.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have an AWS account. If you need help creating your account, check out our [AWS Cloud Quickstart](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/aws-cloud-quickstart) repository.


## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives of This Project Challenge (Lab)

The objective of this challenge is to use Amazon SageMaker Canvas to build a stock forecasting model. Through this project, you will:

 - Select and import a relevant dataset.
 - Train a machine learning model.
 - Analyze the performance metrics of the model.
 - Make predictions and analyze the results.


## ðŸš€ Step by Step

### 1. Select Dataset

-   Navigate to the `datasets` folder of this repository. This folder contains datasets that you can choose to train and test your ML model. Feel free to generate/enrich your own datasets; the more you engage, the more relevant this project will be in your portfolio.
Choose the dataset you will use to train your stock forecasting model.
Upload the dataset to SageMaker Canvas.

  For this project, I used the dataset `vendas_consoles_brasil.csv`, which contains sales data of consoles in Brazil. The dataset includes information such as the sale date, console type, quantity sold, unit price, and total revenue.

### 2. Build/Train

 - In SageMaker Canvas, import the dataset you selected.
 - Configure the input and output variables according to the data.
 - Start the model training. This can take some time, depending on the size of the dataset.

### 3. Analyze

-   After training, examine the performance metrics of the model.
-   Check the main features that influence the predictions.
-   Make adjustments to the model if necessary and retrain until you achieve satisfactory performance.

### 4. Predict

-  Use the trained model to make stock predictions.
-  Export the results and analyze the generated predictions.
-  Document your conclusions and any insights gained from the predictions.

###   Results Analysis
Here are the prediction results generated by the model:

| Console	| Probability |
| -------- | -------- |
Nintendo Switch	| 18.93%
PlayStation 4	| 18.95%
PlayStation 5	| 18.90%
Xbox One	| 18.94%
Xbox Series X	| 24.29%

### Conclusions
The analysis of the results showed that the model most likely predicts the sale of Xbox Series X consoles, with a probability of 24.29%. The predictions for the other consoles are quite close, indicating that the model found a similar distribution among the options.
